== Overview


*SAP HANA DEPLOY MANAGE SATELLITE TOWER* _config_ will cover the workshop 'SAP HANA Deploy and Manage with Satellite and Tower'. 

This workshop is intended for primarily individual client in leadership roles as well as those who are not CLI savvy and is intended to showcase the ability of the RHEL Platform to more efficiently deploy and mange a HANA environment than SLES.

It is a fork of Mak's SAP SMART and we will endevor to maintain the extensibility of his original which can easily be extended via it's `default_vars.yml` to less or more machines and also to different operating system images.

Text below is from Mak's original and will be updated as we progress

== Supported Cloud Providers

* OSP

== Review the Env_Type variable file

The link:./default_vars.yml[./default_vars.yml] file contains all the variables you need to define to control the deployment of your environment.

This includes the ability to:

* Change the number of machines deployed
* Changed the operating system image
* Change the tags carried by any instances
* Change the base packages installed
* Change/set the `ansible_user` and `remote_user`

These can be over-ridden at `ansible-playbook` runtime via `-e` options or perhaps more compactly by overriding vars in your own var file and invoking via `-e @my_secret_env_vars.yml`

For further information on customizing images consult the link:../../../docs/Creating_a_config.adoc[Creating a Config Guide]

== Deploying the SAP SMART Config

You can deploy this config by running the following command from the `ansible`
directory. You will have to provide credentials and adjust settings to your own
environment.

`ansible-playbook -e @configs/sap-smart/default_vars.yml main.yml`

Or ideally using an external not shared vars file where to pass OSP credentials and others

`ansible-playbook -e @my_secret_env_vars.yml main.yml`

=== To Delete an environment
----

ansible-playbook -e @configs/sap-smart/sample_vars.yml \
  configs/sap-destroy/destroy_env.yml

Or the custom variables file you used for the deployment:

ansible-playbook -e @my_secret_env_vars.yml \
  configs/sap-smart/destroy_env.yml
